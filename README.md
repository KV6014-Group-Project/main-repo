## Django Backend
The backend is built using Django REST Framework. I would recommend using the UV package manager for managing dependencies and virtual environments.
to install UV, run the following command:
```
pip install uv
```

Then to update dependencies, use:
```
uv update
```

Then to run the development server, use:
```
uv run python manage.py runserver
```
